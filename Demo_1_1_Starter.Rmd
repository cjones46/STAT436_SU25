[Catalan Elections] The `Catalan_elections` dataset contains data on eleven elections in a region of Spain; in each election, the percentage of voters in each of 949 municipalities voting for "Indy" or for "Unionist" are tracked.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(ggbeeswarm)
Catalan_elections
```

a. Use a geom from `ggplot2` to visualize: In each of the 11 elections in the dataset, what was the distribution of % voters for Indy in each municipality?

```{r}

```

b. Use either `geom_density_ridges` from `ggridges` or `geom_beeswarm` from `ggbeeswarm` to answer the same question.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

c. Why did you choose the `geom` you did in part b? How does it improve on the plot from part a?
